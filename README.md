# Background

Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing technique concerned with detecting favourable and unfavourable opinions in textual data. It can be used to answer questions about peopleâ€™s feeling towards a certain topic.

Due to the large volumes of textual data produced on the Internet, sentiment analysis has lately been included in the research toolbox of many companies as a way to find out what customers think about their product and organisation. 

There are two major approaches to sentiment analysis: 

- Rule based: in which a dictionary is used for automatic classification of sentiment 
- Feature based: in which machine learning models are trained based on labelled data

In this project I have tried both approaches but focused on a machine learning approach using Naive Bayes Classification. 

I wanted to explore the use of sentiment analysis in organisations and how sentiment analysis can be used for analysing reviews.

## Hypothesis

HO: Naive Bayes Classification is not a good method for analysing customer reviews
HA: Naive Bayes Classification is a good method for analysing customer reviews
